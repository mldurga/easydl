        "CNN - Convolutional Neural Networks, is most famous technique used in computer vision applications off-late. Due to rapid innovation and research in this field, these techniques undergo huge transformations in short period of time. Here is my effort to deliberate upon certain terminology and concepts so that it would not be too scary for beginners like me. This topic is a very basic introduction to the concepts and will write a basic CNN and train a classifier of handwritten vernacular vowels of my mother-tongue Telugu. "

In the context of computer vision, Neural Networks are fed with image type data and output will be any of the deep learning applications like image recognition, object detection or image classification etc. As shown in image, multiple layers of network will get trained to do specified task (ex:image recognition) by applying algorithms and improve accuracy of given task by reducing error.\n",
